# Joe Chen
Hi, this is Joe, I'm from Shanghai China. I am really interest in psychoanalysis, so I came to the UK to learn it. Now I am a psychosocial and psychoanalysis study year 2 student, I am proud of myself could study with my classmates. I like to help people, but sometimes I am a bit hesitate to communicate with others. I also like to observe poeple's behaviour, because I think human is the most mydterious object in the world. I traveled through almost the whole China, I have observed many different cultures in China and I love to find out the difference of residents between cities and countrysides.


## Social media
Because China mainland do not allow residents to use google services, we use some different social media to contact.

## Education
My junior highschool and highschool graduated in an international highschool which combined both junior hoghschool and highschool. Compare to other Asian, I understand and accept more 'western culture', such as the difference between Asian are more collective and Western are more individual. 


## Now
I am a second year student in department PPS
I wish to complete a degree in PPS, master is more satisfied. 
I have done a dozen of assignments, most of them are essays.


## Why I chose PPS (Psychosocial and Psychoanalysis Study) as my major?
When I was in highschool, I totally do not study and I hate studying. My parents were worried about me so they found me a psychotherapist to improve my status. After a few sessions of psychotherapy, I felt I am not hate studying any more then I started to study a little bit and had more and more acceptability. I discovered how important is a psychotherapist for a person, it is a great job. On the other hand, I really like to chat with person (usually only one) and listen to their troubles and try to help them, psychoanalysis knowledge could make it more effective and correctly. 


## Work experience
I have not join a parttime or a full time job

I have contributed in a few volunteering activities


## My hobby
When I have spare time, I usually play my computer at home. I am interested in video games, I used to have high ranked in many games for example, league of legens, APEX Legens, PUBG etc. I used to ride horses, if you know a bit about equestrain then dreessage is what I focused on. Equestrain is a good sport that you can interact with horses, you
could exactly feel your horse's feeling and mood by the action between you and the horse. I also be attracted by technical devices such as computer, laptop, and smartphone. 
I have a bit experience and knowledge about these devices (but honesly just the hardware), and I like to spend some casual time to update them. Sometimes I go to the centre of the town, watching the crowd and feeling the culture.
